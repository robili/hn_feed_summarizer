The new options, PerSourcePenalties and PerSourcePenaltyExemptList, monitor client behavior and penalize them for repeated unsuccessful authentication attempts or causing sshd to crash. PerSourcePenalties will be enabled by default in the upcoming OpenBSD 7.6 release. Admins need to be aware of the consequences of inconsiderate NAT use when using these options.

It explains that PID 0 does exist and is responsible for scheduling and power management, but is not shown to users through traditional APIs. The text criticizes the incorrect information found on the internet about PID 0, particularly stemming from a 16-year-old sentence on Wikipedia. It goes on to provide historical context and examples from Unix kernels to explain the role of PID 0 in different versions. It concludes by clarifying that PID 0 does not handle paging or virtual memory management as commonly believed.
